## Maximus LMS API

The Maximus LMS API is intended to compete in the open source learning management system ecosystem, as an alternative to sometimes cumbersome and unwieldy systems. Students can enroll themselves in courses, teachers can create new courses, and admin-level users can administer the entire system (ie assign roles, create new users, etc.). The Maximus LMS also ties into the [Experience API](https://github.com/adlnet/xAPI-Spec/blob/master/xAPI.md) (also referred to as the [TinCan API](http://tincanapi.com/overview/)) to reward learning that happens outside of this learning management system. The LMS and the [LRS](http://tincanapi.com/learning-record-store/) should be considered separate entities that talk to each other.

Anyone can enroll in any course, and take the course at their own pace.

The LMS provides some basic activities: 

* Reading
* Viewing a video
* Discussion Forum
* Instant Messenger with other logged-in users
* Quiz

This is a prototype/proof-of-concept to fulfill the 3rd and final project for General Assembly's Web Development Immersive.
