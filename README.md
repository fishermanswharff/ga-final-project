## Maximus LMS

The Maximus LMS is intended to compete in the open source learning management system ecosystem, as an alternative to sometimes cumbersome and unwieldy systems. Students can enroll themselves in courses, teachers can create new courses, and admin-level users can administer the entire system (ie assign roles, create new users, etc.). The Maximus LMS also ties into the [Experience API](https://github.com/adlnet/xAPI-Spec/blob/master/xAPI.md) (also referred to as the [TinCan API](http://tincanapi.com/overview/)) to reward learning that happens outside of this learning management system.

This is a prototype/proof-of-concept to fulfill the 3rd and final project for General Assembly's Web Development Immersive.
